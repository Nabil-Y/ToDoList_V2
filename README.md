## My process

### Built with

- LocalStorage
- TypeScript
- Sass
- Sortable.js
- Vite

### What I learned

It was my first project with Typescript so I learned a lot doing it. I used a third party library for the drag and drop feature -> sortable.js

Problem is I started this project without a build tool so I couldn't export third party modules. So I chose Vite and it was fast to get the hang of it. First time using it too.

Also it was my first time using localstorage and creating a dark/light theme switcher that auto detects the user prefered settings, it was really interesting.

Also it will be my first projet deployed on Vercel so I will discover another new tool.

### Continued development

I need more practice with TypeScript and build tools. I'm getting used to integration.
